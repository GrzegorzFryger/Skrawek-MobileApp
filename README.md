# Skrawek-MobileApp
## Details
This application will consume backend API from our engineering project called *Kindergarten System*.
This API is related to common activities that take place in the kindergarten 
(like accounting fees for meals or tuition, checking the presence of children etc.).  

There are few roles, based on which given API is available:
* Parent
* Teacher
* Admin

The goal of this app is to consume at least some part of API for parents.
